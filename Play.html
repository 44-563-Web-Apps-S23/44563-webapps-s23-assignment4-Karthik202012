    <h3>The Last Straw</h3>
    <h4>Author:BOSWORTH CROCKER</h4>
    <P>Bosworth Crocker was born March 2, 1882, in Surrey, England. While still
        a child he was brought to the United States. He lives in New York City
        and may be reached in care of the Society of American Dramatists and
        Composers, 148 West 45th Street.
        
        In addition to _Pawns of War_ and _Stone Walls_, he has written a number
        of one-act plays, _The Dog_, _The First Time_, _The Cost of a Hat_, _The
        Hour Before_, _The Baby Carriage_, and _The Last Straw_.
        
        _The Last Straw_, produced by the Washington Square Players in New York
        City, is an excellent one-act tragedy, based upon the psychological law
        of suggestion.

        THE LAST STRAW[G]
        
             TIME: _The present day._
        
             SCENE: _The basement of a large apartment-house in New York City._
        
             SCENE: _The kitchen of the Bauer flat in the basement of the Bryn
             Mawr. A window at the side gives on an area and shows the walk
             above and the houses across the street. Opposite the windows is a
             door to an inner room. Through the outer door, in the centre of the
             back wall, a dumb-waiter and whistles to tenants can be seen. A
             broken milk-bottle lies in a puddle of milk on the cement floor in
             front of the dumb-waiter. To the right of the outer door, a
             telephone; gas-range on which there are flat-irons heating and
             vegetables cooking. To the left of the outer door is an old
             sideboard; over it hangs a picture of Schiller. Near the centre of
             the room, a little to the right, stands a kitchen table with four
             chairs around it. Ironing-board is placed between the kitchen table
             and the sink, a basket of dampened clothes under it. A large
             calendar on the wall. An alarm-clock on the window-sill. Time: a
             little before noon. The telephone rings_; MRS. BAUER _leaves her
             ironing and goes to answer it_.
        
        
        MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the
        transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
        just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
        
             [MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into
             basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
             BAUER'S _door and looks in_.
        
        
        LANE. Say--where's the boss?
        
        MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?
        
             [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._
        
        LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
        groceries for Sawyers.
        
        MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
        which hangs beside the door._] Here.
        
        LANE. What's the matter?
        
        MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?
        
        LANE. [_Significantly._] Oh, I know.
        
        MRS. BAUER. What you know?
        
        LANE. About the boss. [MRS. BAUER _looks distressed_.] Heard your
        friends across the street talkin'.
        
        MRS. BAUER. [_Bitterly._] Friends!
        
        LANE. Rotten trick to play on the boss, all right, puttin' that old maid
        up to get him pinched.
        
        MRS. BAUER. [_Absently._] Was she an old maid?
        
        LANE. The cruelty-to-animals woman over there [_waves his
        hand_]--regular old crank. Nies[H] put her up to it all right.
        
        MRS. BAUER. I guess it was his old woman. Nies ain't so bad. She's the
        one. Because my two boys dress up a little on Sunday, she don't like it.
        
        LANE. Yes, she's sore because the boys told her the boss kicks their
        dog.
        
        MRS. BAUER. He don't do nothin' of the sort--jus' drives it 'way from
        the garbage-pails--that's all. We coulda had that dog took up long
        ago--they ain't got no license. But Fritz--he's so easy--he jus' takes
        it out chasin' the dog and hollerin'.
        
        LANE. That ain't no way. He ought to make the dog holler--good and
        hard--once; then it'd keep out of here.
        
        MRS. BAUER. Don't you go to talkin' like that 'round my man. Look at all
        this trouble we're in on account of a stray cat.
        
        LANE. I better get busy. They'll be callin' up the store in a minute.
        That woman's the limit.... Send up the groceries in that slop, she'd
        send them down again. High-toned people like her ought to keep maids.
        
             [_He mops out the lower shelf of the dumb-waiter, then looks at the
             broken bottle and the puddle of milk inquiringly._
        
        MRS. BAUER. [_Taking the mop away from him._] I'll clean that up. I
        forgot--in all this trouble.
        
        LANE. Whose milk?
        
        MRS. BAUER. The Mohlers'. That's how it all happened. Somebody upset
        their milk on the dumb-waiter and the cat was on the shelf lickin' it
        up; my man, not noticin', starts the waiter up and the cat tries to jump
        out; the bottle rolls off and breaks. The cat was hurt awful--caught in
        the shaft. I don't see how it coulda run after that, but it did--right
        into the street, right into that woman--Fritz after it. Then it fell
        over. "You did that?" she says to Fritz. "Yes," he says, "I did that."
        He didn't say no more, jus' went off, and then after a while they came
        for him and---- [_She begins to cry softly._
        
        LANE. Brace up; they ain't goin' to do anything to him.... [_Comes into
        kitchen. Hesitatingly._] Say!... He didn't kick the cat--did he?
        
        MRS. BAUER. Who said so?
        
        LANE. Mrs. Nies--says she saw him from her window.
        
        MRS. BAUER. [_As though to herself._] I dunno. [_Excitedly._] Of course
        he didn't kick that cat. [_Again, as though to herself._] Fritz is so
        quick-tempered he mighta kicked it 'fore he knew what he was about. No
        one'd ever know how good Fritz is unless they lived with him. He never
        hurt no one and nothing except himself.
        
        LANE. Oh, I'm on to the boss. I never mind his hollerin'.
        
        MRS. BAUER. If you get a chance, bring me some butter for dinner--a
        pound.
        
        LANE. All right. I'll run over with it in ten or fifteen minutes, soon
        as I get rid of these orders out here in the wagon.
        
        MRS. BAUER. That'll do.
        
             [_She moves about apathetically, lays the cloth on the kitchen
             table and begins to set it._ LANE _goes to the dumb-waiter,
             whistles up the tube, puts the basket of groceries on the shelf of
             the dumb-waiter, pulls rope and sends waiter up_. MRS. BAUER
             _continues to set the table. Boys from the street suddenly swoop
             into the basement and yell_.
        
        CHORUS OF BOYS' VOICES. Who killed the cat! Who killed the cat!
        
        LANE. [_Letting the rope go and making a dive for the boys._] I'll show
        you, you----
        
             [_They rush out_, MRS. BAUER _stands despairingly in the doorway
             shaking her clasped hands_.
        
        MRS. BAUER. Those are Nies's boys.
        
        LANE. Regular toughs! Call the cop and have 'em pinched if they don't
        stop it.
        
        MRS. BAUER. If my man hears them--you know--there'll be more trouble.
        
        LANE. The boss ought to make it hot for them.
        
        MRS. BAUER. Such trouble!
